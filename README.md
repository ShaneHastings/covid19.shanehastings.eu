# COVID-19 Data Ireland | Dashboard

This is the repository for the dashboard I have created in an attempt to visualise some of the data available on the COVID-19 Data Hub, as well as Our World in Data (for vaccines).

### Note
I'll add code for the laboratory tests and cases soon, it needs cleaning first :)
